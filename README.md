This is the first capstone project for Thinkful (https://www.thinkful.com/).
Live App: https://rnguyen89.github.io/see_it/

##Introduction 

see_it is an app that allows you to discover popular movies based on user scores from the movie database (https://www.themoviedb.org/). Users will see a collapsible modal where they can click on one element to review content. In this case, they will see movie poster, movie overview, a modal to view movie trailer. 

##Use Case 

Just a fun app for users to focus on one item. Originally, the app showed all the content and felt boring. It was intended for users that are curious about popular movies that were rated by other users on TMDB.
For instance, searching up movies based on your birth year or maybe searching movies based on your HS grad year.
It is also a great way to see trailers for older movies and compare with newer movies.

##UX  

I opted to create this app using http://materializecss.com/. It was a great way to incorporate collapsible and modals to hide content. The goal was to have users click around, scroll, and watch movie trailers.

##Technical

This app was built using HTML/CSS/JavaScript/jQuery.
The app is fully responsive and uses the API from the movie database (https://www.themoviedb.org/).
